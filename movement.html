<p>Accessibility – the game controls should be easy to learn and use, and take into account human’s physical and cognitive limitations.

    Intent Communication – the game controls should communicate the player’s intent in a way the player expects and create a feeling of full control.
    
    Expression Space – the game controls should give the player enough expression space for mastery, and keep the sufficient level of variety.</p>
    <h2> hand limitations</h2>
    <p>Primary control – thumb & index fingers. Flexible and precise, usable for primary actions (shoot, jump, etc.).

        Secondary control – middle finger. Flexible but not so precise, usable for primary hold actions (aiming mode, [w] for walking, etc.).
        
        Support – ring & pinkie fingers. Weak and not very flexible, can be used for secondary actions.

            Of course, there are different types of actions, with different attention demands. I would divide them this way:

Primary actions – require active decision-making, the main “Verbs”/basic mechanics that the player use. Might include more than one basic inputs (aim & shoot, moving & jumping, etc.). Require constant attention from the player.

State change – actions that switch control modes (hold button to aim, hold the button to run, etc.). Slightly increase the overall level of required attention. Very often, “hold” actions.

Contextual actions – appear from time to time in the context of the primary “Verbs” (reload the weapon, interact, use a special ability, etc.). Require short-term periods of high attention from the player.

From practice and numerous observations, the maximum limit of simultaneous actions (for each hand) is:

One primary action

One state change

One contextual action
